—————————————————————————————-.  
D. Mahmoud and a Dictionary  
time limit per test4 seconds  
memory limit per test256 megabytes  
inputstandard input  
outputstandard output  
Mahmoud wants to write a new dictionary that contains n words and relations
between them. There are two types of relations: synonymy (i. e. the two words
mean the same) and antonymy (i. e. the two words mean the opposite). From time
to time he discovers a new relation between two words.

He know that if two words have a relation between them, then each of them has
relations with the words that has relations with the other. For example, if
like means love and love is the opposite of hate, then like is also the
opposite of hate. One more example: if love is the opposite of hate and hate
is the opposite of like, then love means like, and so on.

Sometimes Mahmoud discovers a wrong relation. A wrong relation is a relation
that makes two words equal and opposite at the same time. For example if he
knows that love means like and like is the opposite of hate, and then he
figures out that hate means like, the last relation is absolutely wrong
because it makes hate and like opposite and have the same meaning at the same
time.

After Mahmoud figured out many relations, he was worried that some of them
were wrong so that they will make other relations also wrong, so he decided to
tell every relation he figured out to his coder friend Ehab and for every
relation he wanted to know is it correct or wrong, basing on the previously
discovered relations. If it is wrong he ignores it, and doesn’t check with
following relations.

After adding all relations, Mahmoud asked Ehab about relations between some
words based on the information he had given to him. Ehab is busy making a
Codeforces round so he asked you for help.

Input  
The first line of input contains three integers n, m and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤
m, q ≤ 105) where n is the number of words in the dictionary, m is the number
of relations Mahmoud figured out and q is the number of questions Mahmoud
asked after telling all relations.

The second line contains n distinct words a1, a2, …, an consisting of small
English letters with length not exceeding 20, which are the words in the
dictionary.

Then m lines follow, each of them contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) followed
by two different words xi and yi which has appeared in the dictionary words.
If t = 1, that means xi has a synonymy relation with yi, otherwise xi has an
antonymy relation with yi.

Then q lines follow, each of them contains two different words which has
appeared in the dictionary. That are the pairs of words Mahmoud wants to know
the relation between basing on the relations he had discovered.

All words in input contain only lowercase English letters and their lengths
don’t exceed 20 characters. In all relations and in all questions the two
words are different.

Output  
First, print m lines, one per each relation. If some relation is wrong (makes
two words opposite and have the same meaning at the same time) you should
print “NO” (without quotes) and ignore it, otherwise print “YES” (without
quotes).

After that print q lines, one per each question. If the two words have the
same meaning, output 1. If they are opposites, output 2. If there is no
relation between them, output 3.

See the samples for better understanding.

题目大意:  
就是有n个单词,有m个关系,q个查询,  
** 关系 ** 是两个单词是同义词还是反义词,对于当前的这条关系如果与前述关系不符则忽略,   
** 查询 ** 是两个单词之间的关系是 ** 同义词 ** 还是 ** 反义词 ** 还是 ** 未知 ** . 

解题思路:  
很好想到并查集来维护同义词,然后用另一个数组怎样的表示两堆之间的反义词关系,

<del> 最开始是想对每堆进行染色,两个堆中一个染成+n,另一个染成-n,加和为零表示敌对关系,然后可以在维护一个并查集或者怎样 ,但是最后GG了
</del>

看了题解 发现用另一个数组来维护本堆的反义词的堆是哪一个，真是奥妙重重。666

这样的话 这个题目就简单清晰多了，直接维护就行了。

注意对于m条关系的判定时的细节就好了，详见代码。
